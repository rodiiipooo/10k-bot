ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance
fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our
products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our
customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers,
Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the
widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of
our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop
full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for
our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and
other services tailored to our products. 

Our mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition
to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise,
vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other
companies. 

Segment Information 

We operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii)
energy generation and storage. 

The automotive segment includes the design, development,
manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as sales of
automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and
other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop
and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy
generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of
solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy
systems incentives. 

Our Products and Services 

Automotive 

We currently manufacture five
different consumer vehicles &#8211; the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door
mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal.
Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (&#8220;SUV&#8221;) built on the Model 3 platform with
seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV
with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance
characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023,
we entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size
electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has the utility and strength of a truck
while featuring the speed of a sports car. 

In 2022, we also began early production and deliveries
of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to address a

Overview and 2023 Highlights 

Our mission is to accelerate the
world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell
high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage
products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and
other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and
services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. 

In 2023, we produced 1,845,985
consumer vehicles and delivered 1,808,581 consumer vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing
vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our
vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, improving
and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our
vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure, including our
service and charging infrastructure. 

In 2023, we deployed 14.72 GWh of energy storage products and
223 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy
storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing
market share of retrofit solar energy systems. 

In 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77
billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp
production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased
deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our
AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth. 

In 2023, our net income
attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44
billion, compared to the prior year. This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion
for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. We continue to focus on
further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.
